Many modern paintings are popular because of their thought-provoking nature.
 In fact, many people value them according to how well they can spark a conversation with house guests or office clients.
 They can open one's mind to a new perspective of the world, while others stir the emotions and some simply set a tone for a room.
 Not only can these paintings be appreciated for their beauty, some are also sound investments that may offer great resale value. 
</h3>Buyers of modern paintings can benefit from knowing the 10 most popular modern painting styles and how to distinguish one from the other.<br>
<u>WE PROVIDE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAINTING</U><br>
    <h2><u> 1.Abstract Art</h2></u><br>
Abstract art refers to a style of painting that does not use figurative reality as a reference.
 Instead, the artist alludes to their subject and reduces it to a simplified form.
 Colors and shapes are used to portray emotions and the landscape of one's inner world.
 Listed below are the various kinds of abstract art styles that have emerged.<br>
<h2><u>2. Surrealism</h2></u><br>
Surrealism is a modern painting style that juxtaposes various images together to give a startling effect.
 The images are often illogical and have a dream-like quality about them. Surrealist paintings emphasize the subconscious.<br>

<h2><u>3. Conceptual Art</u></h2><br>
Conceptual art is a modern art style where the artist believes that concept is more important than artwork itself.
 Many conceptual artists believed that while they conceived the work, it is completed by the viewer.<br>

<h2><u>4. Pop Art</u></h2><br>
Pop Art paintings occurred as a reaction to abstract expressionism, which mid-1950s British artists believed was art that was far-removed from daily life.
 Pop Art revolved around mundane subjects like comic books, advertising, celebrities, and other objects found in the everyday.<br>

<h2><u>5. Photorealism</u></h2><br>
From the name itself, a photorealist painting is one that looks as realistic as a photograph.
 This is done by taking a picture of the subject and then painting it.
 Photorealism is an art movement influenced by pop art, and it ran counter as a reaction to abstract expressionism. <br>

<h2><u>6. Hyperrealism</u></h2><br>
Hyperrealism is an advancement of the photorealism art movement. 
Artists use high-resolution cameras to take photographs and paint them on canvas.<br> 
<h2><u>7. Minimalism</u></h2><br>
Minimalism is an art movement that is, as expected, characterized by simplicity.
 Minimalist paintings strip down the subject to its very essence.
 Instead of energy-filled self-expression as is the hallmark of abstract expressionism, 
minimalist art, on the other hand, paints only what the artist believes is necessary.<br>

<h2><u>8. Futurism</u></h2><br>
Futurism is a painting style that concerns itself with subjects like the technology,
 speed, violence, and the future of the world
. It concerns itself with the depiction of man's triumph over nature.<br>
<h2><u>9. Impressionism</h2></u><br>
Impressionism is one of the earliest modern painting styles that originated in Paris, France.
 It is characterized by thin brushstrokes and an emphasis on the depiction of light.
 Impressionist artists often painted outdoors to capture the sunlight and color of their subjects.<br>

<h2><u>10. Fauvism</u></h2><br>
Fauvism is an art movement that occurred sometime after impressionism.
 While impressionism retains a somewhat realistic representation of the subjects, Fauvist paintings focus on strong color.<br>
